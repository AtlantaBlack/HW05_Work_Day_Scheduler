# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Schedulers are helpful tools for planning the day, figuring out workflow, and general organisational purposes. It gives the user a clear visual as to the tasks that need to be done for each hourly block of the day.

This scheduler was built using jQuery and Bootstrap, and utilises Moment.js for time keeping and Web APIs for storing and retrieving the data. Users are able to type in their tasks for each hour and save it to their browser, which will display their tasks even upon page refresh. Each hour block will change colour depending whether the hour has passed over the current time, or is still yet to come.
